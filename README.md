Working on collecting and making a full collection of updated tutorials and injections with new CFRU tutorials also.
 Hello! Here we start! 
 ## 1. The Introduction 
 Rom hacking is just modifying the roms and changing data in them and adding features and many more changes. Nowadays Rom hacking is of two types - Decomps and Binary. 
 We won't go for decomps in this series. This is all about fire red tutorials.
 We start , but before you would need some knowledge on playing rom hacks , running emulator , patching.
 We use fire red v1.0 or 1636 squirrels for rom hacking mostly.l
